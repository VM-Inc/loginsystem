# Configuring the sql on phpmyadmin

To configure the sql to the files in it .Open the **configure my sql.txt** file and copy the code in the sql section of myphpadmin. Or you can use the better way of making it that is uploading the sql file to the phpmyadmin.

And to make it easy we have made a video for it and how to use it.Or you can see the documentetion on our offical site [VM](http://gestyy.com/wPEag9). We use [xampp](http://gestyy.com/wPEaYu) localhost server to run the program. You can take a help for knowing the localhost/phpmyadmin and localhost . Download all the files with the GitHub and extract it in your htdocs folder on your computer/website. Then you can configure the sql with localhost/phpmyadmin .

## After configuring

After the configuration simply type your url localhost/yourfoldername and open it . You will need internet for the first time, then signup and login in the website.
